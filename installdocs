This script sets up the environment associated with the indico IDE. Following is a breakdown of ther operations it performs on your computer. In the case of one or more of these failing, you can use this as a guide to manually make them. 

First it checks to make sure that you have both pip and python, as well as brew on osx. If any of these are missing they will be installed. 

Next, a directory is created in your home directory called .indico, which itself contains the subdirectory pypackages. This is where pip will install packages. The exact path to where they are installed can be found will be added to your python path in your bashrc in linux or your bash_profile in osx. There is currently no support for windows. If you use windows, consider not doing that. 

The libraries installed are:
    indico
        our own machine learning api
    opencv
       	powerful industry standard for image processing
    sk-learn
        fully featured machine learning library containing many general purpose tools
    sk-image
        more specialized computer vision library focused on providing scientific computing and machine learning tools
    numpy
        blazing fast linear algebra and n-dimensional matrix math library
    scipy
        powerful scientific computing tools built on top of, and fully compatible with numpy
    pandas
        powerful tool for working with datasets (particularly CSVs)
    (g)requests
        tool for headless interactions with websites
    lxml
        absurdly fast xml parser
    matplotlib
        powerful data visualization and graphing utility that plays nice with numpy and opencv

In addition, all of these libraries will have their dependencies installed.
