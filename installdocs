This script sets up the environment associated with the indico IDE. Following is a breakdown of ther operations it performs on your computer. In the case of one or more of these failing, you can use this as a guide to manually make them. 

first it check to make sure that you have both pip and python, as well as brew on osx. If any of these are missing they will be installed. 

next, a directory is created in your home directory called .indico, which itself contains the subdirectory pypackages. This is where pip will install packages. The exact path to where they are installed can be found will be added to your python path in your bashrc in linux or your bash_profile in osx. There is currently no support for windows. If you use windows, consider not doing that. 

the libraries installed are:
    indico
        our own machine learning api
    opencv
        powerful industry standard for image processing
    sk-learn
        enormously featured machine learning library containing many general purpose tools
    sk-image
        a more specialized computer vision library focused on providing scientific computing and machine learning tools
    numpy
        blazing fast linear algebra and n-dimensional matrix math library
    scipy
        powerful scientific computing tools built on top of, and fully compatible with numpy
    pandas
        a powerful tool for working with datasets, particularly CSVs, it replicates, and integrates some of R's functionality
    (g)requests
        a tool for headless interactions with websites very useful for scraping. grequests is an asynchronous version of requests
    lxml
        absurdly fast xml parser, also useful for 
    matplotlib
        powerful data visualization and graphing utility. plays nice with numpy and opencv. 

in addition all of these will have their dependencies installed
